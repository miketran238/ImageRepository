**Mike's Image Repository**
========
Hi, this is my project for the Shopify Coding challenge. <br />
I tried to simulate an image repository with the core functionality to Buy/Sell images. <br />
There is an intial credit to ease the check out process which can be handled with a third-party API.
User can buy image which is added to the cart. Total price on the cart will update simultaneously. 
Quantity on the cart can reduced which will be added back to the inventory.
Checking out will empty the cart and reduce the user's total credit.
The project is built purely on React with Redux with some simple CSS style.
