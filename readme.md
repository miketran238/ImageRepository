<b>Mike's Image Repository </b>
========
Hi, this is my project for the Shopify Coding challenge.
I tried to simulate an image repository with the core functionality to Buy/Sell images.
There is an intial credit to ease the check out process which can be handled with a third-party API.
The project is built purely on React with Redux with some simple CSS style.
